"""Async-safe wrapper for blocking document-generation calls.

Every Office-document generator in this project (``markdown_to_word``,
``markdown_to_excel``, ``create_presentation``, ``create_eml``,
``create_xml_file``, and every dynamically-registered template tool) is a
synchronous, blocking function. They perform:

  * file I/O (opening .docx / .pptx templates, which are zip archives)
  * CPU-bound markdown / mustache rendering
  * synchronous network I/O (``requests.get`` for image downloads,
    ``boto3`` S3 uploads)

FastMCP runs on top of an asyncio event loop (uvicorn / Starlette).
Calling a blocking function directly from an ``async def`` MCP tool
handler freezes the loop for the full duration of the call — no other
request can be served, including the Kubernetes liveness / readiness
probes. Repeated probe timeouts cause kubelet to SIGTERM the pod, which
is the failure mode observed in EKS:

    ERROR: ASGI callable returned without completing response.
    ERROR: Cancel 0 running task(s), timeout graceful shutdown exceeded

(The "0 running tasks" line is the giveaway: there were no async tasks
because the work was running synchronously on the event loop itself.)

Whether blocking work is offloaded to a worker thread is controlled by
the ``RUN_BLOCKING_BY_ASYNCIO_THREAD_ENABLED`` environment variable
(see ``config.Config.run_blocking_by_asyncio_thread_enabled``):

  * Disabled (default) — call the sync function inline on the event
    loop. The loop is blocked until the call returns. This is the
    legacy behaviour for static tools; dynamic tools (previously
    registered as sync ``def`` and auto-threaded by FastMCP) will also
    run on the event loop in this mode, since the dynamic handlers are
    now ``async def`` wrappers around ``run_blocking``.
  * Enabled — dispatch the sync function to asyncio's default thread
    pool via ``asyncio.to_thread``. The event loop stays free to serve
    health probes and concurrent requests. Recommended for EKS.

All tool call sites uniformly write ``await run_blocking(func, *args,
**kwargs)`` — the helper internally chooses the dispatch strategy based
on config, so call sites never branch on the flag.

This helper lives in its own module (not inside ``main.py``) so that
dynamically-registered tool modules can import it without creating a
circular dependency back through ``main``.

# Why a bounded executor (instead of `asyncio.to_thread`'s default)?
#
# `asyncio.to_thread` runs on Python's default executor whose
# ``max_workers = min(32, os.cpu_count() + 4)``. On EKS, ``os.cpu_count()``
# returns the **host's** core count (not the pod CPU limit), so the default
# can spawn ~32 worker threads on a 1-vCPU pod. For CPU-bound, pure-Python
# work (such as ``markdown_to_word`` parsing) the GIL serialises all of
# them onto a single core anyway, and each thread receives only a small
# slice of CPU. Concurrent requests pile up and every one of them takes
# 10×+ longer than it should — exceeding the client's timeout while the
# event loop stays "healthy".
#
# A bounded executor with a small ``max_workers`` (default 4 for a 1 vCPU
# pod) keeps concurrent work to a level the GIL can actually progress
# through:
#
#   * 1 thread holds the GIL doing CPU work (markdown parsing)
#   * up to 3 others can be in I/O (S3 upload / image download) — they
#     release the GIL while blocked on syscalls
#   * additional requests queue cleanly in the executor's work queue
#     instead of fanning out and starving each other
#
# Tunable via ``RUN_BLOCKING_MAX_WORKERS`` (see config.Config). Recreate
# the executor by deleting this module from ``sys.modules`` (tests do
# this through their reload helper).

      remains responsive to health probes and concurrent requests while
